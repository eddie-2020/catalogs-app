# Ruby-Capstone-Project

Here in this project we have implemented the following requirements:

- Create Item class in a `item.rb` file.

- All Item class properties visible in the diagram should be defined and set up in the constructor method. Exception: properties for the 1-to-many relationships should NOT be set in the constructor method. Instead, they should have a custom setter method created.

- Add all methods visible in the diagram.

- Implement methods:
  - can_be_archived?() in the Item class
    - should return true if published_date is older than 10 years
    - otherwise, it should return false
  - move_to_archive() in the Item class
    - should reuse can_be_archived?() method
    - should change the archived property to true if the result of the can_be_archived?() method is true
    - should do nothing if the result of the can_be_archived?() method is false

- Create a main.rb file that will serve as your console app entry-point.
- Implement startup actions:
  - Present the user with a list of options to perform.
  - Let users choose an option.
  - If needed, ask for parameters for the option.
  - Have a way to quit the app.
