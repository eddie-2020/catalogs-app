# Ruby-Capstone-Project

In this project we created a console app that helps you to keep a record of different types of things you won: books, music albums and games. Everything is based on the UML class diagram presented in the project requirements. The data is stored in JSON files but a database has also been prepared with tables structure analogical to the projects class structure.
